I am deeply saddened to share the news of the passing of Khun Nopporn, a cherished friend and esteemed leader.

Khun Nopporn was more than just a remarkable business leader; he was a person of extraordinary gentleness, kindness, and warmth. In moments of unresolved conflicts and challenges, he had the unique ability to bring all concerned parties together, finding paths to resolution where none seemed possible. His ability to care for people was unparalleled; he treated everyone with a genuine kindness that left a lasting impact on all who had the privilege of knowing him.

One of the things I will remember most about Khun Nopporn is his unforgettable smileâ€”a smile that could light up a room and bring comfort in the most trying times. His presence was a beacon of hope and compassion, and his legacy will continue to inspire us all.

While we mourn his loss, we also celebrate the incredible person he was and the profound impact he had on our lives. His leadership, care, and warmth will remain in our hearts forever.

With deepest sympathy,
Benjamin KamMing Wong,
From Hong Kong, Ex GEIS ASPAC VP and GECS Board of Director
