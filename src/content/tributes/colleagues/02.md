title: In Memory of Khun Nopporn
---


We were friends and were board members of GECS since its formation 25 years ago.

I was very shocked and saddened by the sudden demise of Khun Nopporn as I was looking forward to meeting him again for the upcoming scheduled GECS board meeting.

In the years of my association with him, he was a true gentleman and never lost his cool. His comments during the board meeting were astute and always give a healthy balance opinion on the contentious issues.

We are going to miss his contributions to the growth of GECS.

In conclusion, it is the most unfortunate I never had an opportunity to say my goodbye to him. May his soul rest in eternal peace.

Regards,  
Dr. TS Lee
