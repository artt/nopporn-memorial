title: Until We Meet Again, My Dear Friend.
---


Dear Khun Nopporn, I find myself reminiscing about the times we shared together, especially our beautiful moments over whisky and cigars in many places in Thailand. Your presence always brought warmth and joy into our evening. In the earlier days where we go for karaoke, your performances were nothing short of legendary. Always love to listen to your singing especially our favorite song “New York, New York”. Your sincerity and genuine friendship were qualities that made you truly special.

As the days pass, I continue to feel the void left by your absence. The memories we created together are now cherished treasure that I hold close to my heart. Your friendship was a gift that I will always be grateful.

Though you may not be here physically, your spirit lives on with us. I take comfort in knowing that you are watching over us, singing your heart out in the great karaoke bar in heaven.

Until we meet again, my dear friend. Rest in peace.

Your friend.  
Chee Ming, Yaw.
