For as long as I can remember, my father, Tomm Nopporn Suwanik, was a modern and artistic parent. He never forced his teachings upon me but instead gave me the opportunity to understand and think for myself. When it came to lessons or advice, he had a way of communicating that never hurt my feelings but instead helped me realize things on my own. Truly, he was the "cool dad" that every child would wish for.

My father often said he raised me to be able to "fly high or stay grounded." This means striving for success while remaining humble and grounded. He didn't just preach this philosophy but also lived it as an example, allowing me to reflect and decide how to conduct myself.

I am who I am today because of my father’s unwavering support, care, and guidance. On this occasion, I would like to record and share some of the wisdom he imparted, which I believe is valuable for being both a good person and a capable one, especially for the new generation stepping up to shape the future of our country and the world.

1. **Don’t Make Yourself the Center of Everything**:
My father always emphasized this lesson, which I believe was passed down from my grandfather, Professor Emeritus Dr.Romsai Suwanik. He would say, “Don’t be self-centered because the world doesn’t revolve around you.” This teaching helps reduce ego because as we grow in power, status, or influence, we risk thinking the world must align with our desires. Such thinking only leads to dissatisfaction and alienation, as people might associate with us only for temporary benefits, not genuine respect.

2. **Do Your Best, Even If the Results Don’t Match Your Expectations**:
This advice has been one of the most impactful lessons I’ve shared with others. Striving for success doesn’t always guarantee the desired outcome due to external factors like fate or circumstances. However, as long as we’ve done our best, we should feel proud of ourselves. Success isn’t just about the outcome but also about valuing the journey we took to get there.

3. **Wealth Shouldn’t Be Life’s Sole Objective**:
While it’s true that money provides comfort and opportunities, my father emphasized that other goals are just as important. Inspired by my grandfather’s example, my father consistently demonstrated the importance of helping others. He was a source of support for those in need, a mentor to his subordinates, and a kind figure even to children who weren’t his own.

4. **Avoid Unnecessary Debt**:
This teaching is particularly relevant today when household debt levels in Thailand are alarmingly high. My father often reminded me, especially when I started working, to save for luxuries I would like to have rather than incurring unnecessary debt to get them. He taught me to appreciate the value of hard-earned money.

5. **Actions, Not Birth, Define a Person’s Worth**:
My father lived by this principle, inherited from my grandfather, who rose from humble beginnings through his perseverance and support from my grandmother. My father’s life exemplified this value, showing that one’s character is shaped by actions rather than privileges of birth.

6. **Humility Makes You Lovable**:
My father often reminded me of the importance of humility, especially during moments of success. It’s a quality that earns genuine affection and respect from others.

7. **Those Who Have Don’t Flaunt; Those Who Flaunt Don’t Have**:
This timeless wisdom resonates in today’s materialistic world. My father taught me that true wealth and status don’t require display. This perspective has sharpened my ability to understand people.

8. **Speech Reflects Language; Actions Reflect Upbringing**:
My father stressed the importance of manners and composure in social settings. For instance, he advised eating with mindfulness—not too fast or slow—which not only reflects good manners but also benefits physical health.

9. **Live Cautiously, Wherever You Go**:
Whenever I traveled, my father would remind me not only to wish for good luck but also to stay vigilant. This principle has been a cornerstone of my life, ensuring that I approach everything with care and awareness.

10. **Be Kind, But Don’t Let Others Exploit You**:
My father emphasized that while doing good is important, we must also set boundaries to avoid being taken advantage of. Being kind doesn’t mean letting others exploit us.

11. **Gratitude Is the Foundation of Success**:
My father demonstrated gratitude through his actions, particularly toward my grandparents. He regularly spent time with them, sought their advice, and reciprocated their love and care, showing me that gratitude leads to a fulfilling life.

12. **Pure Love Is Unconditional**:
My father taught me that conditional love, based on expectations, often leads to suffering. True love, whether for family, friends, or humanity, should be free from conditions and expectations.

I sincerely hope that some of these lessons from my father will serve as a source of inspiration for those who read them. If you find any of these teachings valuable, may they guide you in life and honor my father’s legacy by sharing his wisdom with others.
